Fuzzy Learning with Haskell

A personal research-driven repository exploring Fuzzy Set Theory, Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Control Systems, and Linguistic Variables implemented in Haskell.
This repository serves as:
- A structured self-learning log
- A bridge between mathematics and functional programming
- An experimental playground for fuzzy systems
- An introduction to Granular Computing (GrC)
